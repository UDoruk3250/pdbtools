A new python library to process .pdb files easier!

* Reads, processes .pdb files and outputs the files easily and fast.


* Send me an e-mail through [duzunarslan27@my.uaa.k12.tr](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ogbl#inbox) if you find anything wrong, deficient, or inadequate. I would be happy to help people.

## How to use:

````
pip install pdbtools
````
```
import pdbtools
```


You first need to install the package via pip. In later
versions, the number of the platforms will be increased.
Then you should be ready to use this library.
***
## Structure:
As this is my first python package, I tried to keep 
things simple and concise.
